Classification Models For Cancer Detecton
Introduction
The purpose of this blog post/notebook is to practice using classification models for cancer detection. We will be working with breast tissue data provided by the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine learning course which can be found here. We will go over logistic regression with and without l1 regularization as well as evaluating both models.
